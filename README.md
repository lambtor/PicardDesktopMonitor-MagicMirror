# PicardMonitor

This project is my attempt to build an LCARS kiosk using a copy of the MagicMirror project.<br><br>

This version is intended to run on a raspberry pi zero with a hyperpixel screen.  Many of the modules have been heavily modified, and the assembly of hardware is completely custom / original.<br><br>
