# PicardMonitor

This project is my attempt to build an LCARS kiosk using a copy of the <a href='https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror'>MagicMirror project</a>.<br><br>

At best, this is a highly customized fork of their project.  

This version is intended to run on a raspberry pi zero with a hyperpixel screen.  Many of the modules have been heavily modified, and the assembly of hardware is completely custom / original.<br><br>
